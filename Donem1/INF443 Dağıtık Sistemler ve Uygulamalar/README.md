## Week 1: Introduction to Distributed Systems

Book `Distributed Computing with Python` by `Francesco Pierfederici`

> Parallel computing is the simultaneous use of more than one processor to solve a problem.

> Even though they both run on a single computer, a multithreaded application is an example of shared-memory architecture, whereas a multiprocess
application is an example of distributed memory architecture

> Distributed computing is the simultaneous use of more than one computer to solve a `common` big problem.

## Week 2: Concurrency vs Parallelism
```
Asynchronous programming style = nonblocking programming 
```

 - [Concurrency](https://github.com/uzay00/GSU-Dersler/blob/main/INF443%20Da%C4%9F%C4%B1t%C4%B1k%20Sistemler%20ve%20Uygulamalar/Code/Week2/Threads.ipynb)
 - [Parallelism](https://github.com/uzay00/GSU-Dersler/blob/main/INF443%20Da%C4%9F%C4%B1t%C4%B1k%20Sistemler%20ve%20Uygulamalar/Code/Week2/MultiProcessing.ipynb)

### Amdahl's law

> The execution time of the algorithm described here on n processors is equal—and
generally greater—than the execution time of its serial part on one processor (that is,
S*T(1)) plus the execution time of its parallel part on one processor (that is, P*T(1))
divided by n: the number of processors.

## Week 4: Client-Server architecture for speech analysis
 
Client-Server architecture 
 - Socket Programming [Lecture](https://github.com/uzay00/GSU-Dersler/blob/main/INF443%20Da%C4%9F%C4%B1t%C4%B1k%20Sistemler%20ve%20Uygulamalar/Code/Week5/Socket%20Programming.ipynb)
 - Client [Code](https://github.com/uzay00/GSU-Dersler/blob/main/INF443%20Da%C4%9F%C4%B1t%C4%B1k%20Sistemler%20ve%20Uygulamalar/Code/Week5/echo-client.py) and 
Server [Code](https://github.com/uzay00/GSU-Dersler/blob/main/INF443%20Da%C4%9F%C4%B1t%C4%B1k%20Sistemler%20ve%20Uygulamalar/Code/Week5/echo-server.py)


Combination of speech recognition and text mining

### Homework2 - Speech Analysis with Client-Server Arc.
Using socket programming build 
- a client that can connect to `Google` for speech-to-text
- a multi-threading server that can connect to `Summarify` for sentiment analysis

and let them communicate through internet with TCP


> Service-oriented architecture" (SOA) / __microservices__:
splitting a large software application into multiple services
(on multiple nodes) that communicate via RPC.

Use libraries
 - https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/
 - https://pypi.org/project/sumapi/

### Communication between two computers using python socket
> This program is used for sending "small letters string" from the client and getting "capital letters" from the server

Command-line approach to finding your IP

 - OSX/Linux: ifconfig 
 - Windows: ipconfig /all


## Week 5: Creating a Webapp using streamlit
Example: https://bit.ly/veribilimitesti from https://github.com/uzay00/Streamlit
 - Introduction 2 [streamlit](https://hersanyagci.medium.com/introduction-to-streamlit-for-machine-learning-web-app-cd89c4181c33)

 - Streamlit [Cheatsheet](https://share.streamlit.io/daniellewisdl/streamlit-cheat-sheet/app.py)

### Cloud Computing
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3); nesne depolama 
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): Buluttaki sanal sunucu hizmetidir


> Cloud Computing often referred to as “the cloud”, in simple terms means storing or accessing your data and programs over the internet rather than your own hard drive.
