    "## Socket\n",
    "Sockets are the end-point of a two-way communication link. An endpoint is a combination of IP address and the port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sockets allow communication between processes that lie on the same machine, or on different machines working in diverse environment and even across different continents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network.\n",
    "> They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). \n",
    "\n",
    "port should be an integer from 1-65535 (0 is reserved). It’s the TCP port number to accept connections on from clients. Some systems may require superuser privileges if the port is < 1024.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client -Server\n",
    "one side acts as the server and waits for connections from clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python socket module\n",
    "\n",
    "> Networks are a best-effort delivery system. There’s no guarantee that your data will reach its destination\n",

    " - `socket()`: create a socket\n",
    "  - specify the socket type as `socket.SOCK_STREAM` for `TCP` (relieable, in order)\n",
    "  - `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` is for `UDP` (not relieable, out of order, fast)\n",
    " - `bind()`\n",
    "  - bind() is used to associate the socket with a specific network interface and port number:\n",
    " - `listen()`\n",
    "  - It listens for connections from clients.\n",
    "  - listen() enables a server to accept() connections. It makes it a “listening” socket:\n",
    " - `accept()`\n",
    "  - When a client connects, the server calls accept()\n",
    "  - accept() blocks and waits for an incoming connection. \n",
    "  - When a client connects, it returns a new socket object representing the connection and a tuple holding the address of the client.\n",
    " - `connect()`\n",
    "  - The client calls connect() to establish a connection to the server\n",
    " - `connect_ex()`\n",
    " - `send()`\n",
    "  - exchange data\n",
    " - `recv()`\n",
    "  - exchange data\n",
    " - `close()`\n",
    "  - Client Server close() their respective sockets."
